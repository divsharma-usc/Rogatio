Enum

Roles of users
1. admin
2. normal user(member)
3. moderator
4. editor

we add a column in the user and make enum

0-normal
1-moderator
2-editor
3-admin
we are using numbers because it makes the searching fast

rails built in enum functionality
user.admin?
user.admin!
user.admin

we ll prefer hash


DB
db n plus 1 problem
eager fetching
lazy loading

So how to solve it
we use here a function includes
user.first.feed
in the nested models we ll use includes to reduce the number of queries
